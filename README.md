# memory-card

[Play it here!](https://mbeckdev.github.io/memory-card/)

A quick memory card game where you click cards but not more than once. Every time you click the cards get rearranged.

I made it so that I could practice using React functional components with hooks.

The pictures are my screenshots from my VSCode while I was making this game.
